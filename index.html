        <p>Another day in the office I start my new position</p>
        <p>The walls smelled of success, the carpet of ambition</p>
        <p>I open the door and decide to take a look around</p>
        <p>When, at least, it seems my objective is found</p>
        <p>I stroll around easily, taking it all in</p>
        <p>But there's a sense of evil, there's a sense of sin.</p>
        <p>I try to ignore it, I try let it go</p>
        <p>They had always told me <em>'you reap what you sow'</em></p>
        <p>I blunder around aimlessly, I need to get away</p>
        <p>A sudden shot in the darkness, my vision goes grey</p>
        <p>I know this is it-the final chapter the end</p>
        <p>As I look at the person I once called a friend</p>
